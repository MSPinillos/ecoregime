# ecoregime 0.2.0

## New features

* `resistance()` calculates resistance to disturbances.

* `amplitude()` calculates the amplitude of disturbed trajectories.

* `recovery()` calculates the recovery towards reference trajectories.

* `net_change()` calculates the net change of disturbed trajectories.

* `state_to_trajectory()` defines the position of a state with respect to a trajectory.

* `EDR_data` now includes an abundance matrix for disturbed communities.

* New `vignette("Resilience")` which describes how ecological resilience can be assessed.

## Minor improvements

* `dEve()` error now does not refer to any reference trajectory.

* `define_retra()` returns error if certain characters are used in `trajectories`.

# ecoregime 0.1.3

* `dist_edr()` can be used when states are not in order.

# ecoregime 0.1.2

* Initial CRAN submission.
