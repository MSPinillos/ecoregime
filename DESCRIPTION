Description: A toolbox for implementating the EDR framework (Sánchez-Pinillos et
    al.; DOI) to analyze groups of ecological trajectories in multidimensional 
    spaces defined by state variables. The package includes the RETRA-EDR algorithm 
    to identify representative trajectories, functions to generate, summarize, and 
    visualize representative trajectories, and several metrics to quantify the 
    variability and heterogeneity of trajectories in an ecological dynamic regime
    and quantify the dissimimilarity between two or more ecological dynamic regimes.
